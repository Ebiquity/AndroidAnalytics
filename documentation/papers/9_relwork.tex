\section{Related Work}
Research being done to predict user's preferences by a number of people~\cite{Benisch2011,Sadeh2009,lin2014soups,liu2014www}. Owing to that research we make an assumption that it is possible to fairly accurately create user permission choices on Android devices. However, our goal is separate from theirs in a threefold manner. Firstly we are defining policy rules for users which may allow, deny or allow with caveat specific permissions depending on the user context. Secondly we are not trying to show that it is possible to learn a user's policy from scratch rather we are agreeing with their observation that it is possible to use privacy profiles to define or group user preferences~\cite{liu2014www}. Instead we are trying to show that with user feedback it is possible to reach an individual user's ``perfect'' policy with a certain probability. Thirdly, we are researching ways to include app provenance information, api usage and observed mobile behavior~\cite{enck2010taintdroid} to compute a metric that will accurately measure the trustworthiness of an app.
