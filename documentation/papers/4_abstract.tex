\begin{abstract}
In 2010, the number of mobile devices in the world surpassed the number of personal computers. Mobile devices now carry sensitive personal data, captured through sensors on the phone, as well as confidential corporate data through work emails and apps. As a result, mobile devices have become a lucrative target for attackers, and privacy and security of these devices have become a vital issue. The existing access control mechanisms on these devices, which mostly relies on a single permission grant, is too restrictive and inadequate. Such a mechanism is incapable of controlling contextual or custom app-data flows. In this paper we focus on this scenario and show how data leakages may occur due to developer inadequacy and not having proper checks for such leakages. We describe a design flaw in the Android permission verification mechanism and a way to capture such a vulnerability on a user's mobile device. We show a mechanism of injecting such a vulnerability into any app.
