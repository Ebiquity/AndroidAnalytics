Powered by our unique community of weather enthusiasts reporting live data from weather stations in their own backyards, this crowd-sourced data generates forecasts targeted to your precise location. What\u2019s New in Version 5.1.2?\n\u25cf We\u2019ve remodeled the app like we inherited our grandmother\u2019s house. Don\u2019t worry, we kept the treasured heirlooms, but we threw out the corduroy sofa from 1953. Welcome to the future of Weather Underground on Android.\n\u25cf Off to the left, you\u2019ll find your navigation drawer, which is like your grandfather\u2019s map collection but you\u2019ll actually want to use it. Open the drawer to switch quickly between locations, manage and nickname your favorites, and look wistfully at the weather in the Bahamas.\n\u25cf You used to be limited to one weather station per city. That was dumb. Now you can view and favorite any of our 180,000+ weather stations across the globe using the \u201cRefine\u201d map.\nWe\u2019ve added a new Hurricane tile, because not all weather is nice. Track the weather that\u2019s huffing and puffing before it blows your house down.\n\u25cf There\u2019s a new ad. It\u2019s rectangular, doesn\u2019t bite, and speaks more than a dozen different languages. We\u2019d tap that.\n\u25cf Now optimized for tablets... but it\u2019s not about the size.\n\u25cf Design updates a-go-go. You wanted Material Design? BAM. You wanted improved legibility? BOOM. You wanted to scroll all the way through the forecast without stopping for food or gas? YOU GOT IT.\n\nFEATURES\n\u25cf Status notification: instantly view current temperature and conditions \n\u25cf Current conditions from your local weather station include temperature, feels like, wind speed & direction, humidity, dew point, visibility\n\u25cf 10-day Forecasts (Daily, Hourly) + text summary\n\u25cf Interactive Map showing all the personal weather stations in your neighborhood with animated radar, satellite, and much more data\n\u25cf Favorite Locations and Recent Searches\n\u25cf Crowd reporting \n\u25cf Light or Dark mode\n\u25cf Switch between Forecast on Demand & NWS Forecast\n\u25cf National Weather Service Radio\n\u25cf Health Tile: Monitor air quality, UV risk, & local flu outbreaks\n\u25cf Customizable Widgets\n\u25cf Push notifications: keep an eye out for extreme weather with severe weather alerts\n\u25cf Purchase ad free subscriptions for $1.99 per year\n\nWHAT MAKES THIS WEATHER APP DIFFERENT FROM OTHER APPS?\n\nWE FILL IN THE GAPS\nOur 180,000+ personal weather stations report the most localized weather conditions. The data that we collect from our user-owned weather stations fills in the gaps between the airport weather stations that other weather services rely upon to generate forecasts - meaning our data is generated from actual data points in your neighborhood.\n\nINTERACTIVE WEATHER & RADAR MAP\nThe most interactive weather map on mobile allows you to select from different weather overlays including current conditions, animated radar, satellite, webcams and severe weather. Customize the map by selecting specific data layers or choose from the various map presets such as severe alerts.\n\nCROWD REPORTING\nSky reports let you tell us if the sky conditions we\u2019re reporting are what you're actually observing. If you see something different you can report the conditions you're experiencing for the benefit of other app users. Hazard reports allow you to report any hazardous road conditions you experience to help other people in your area.\n\nABOUT WEATHER UNDERGROUND\nFounded in 1995 as the first online weather service, Weather Underground supplies weather data solutions to the many of the leading media companies and millions of users across the globe through their mobile apps and website wunderground.com.
