With the most robust and precise information of any public transit app, Moovit adds a new city every 24 hours. Combining all your transit options together in a single app, Moovit gives you total control over your travels so you can finally enjoy peace of mind when riding public transportation. \n\nBecause public transportation is always unpredictable, Moovit constantly updates as transit operators change schedules or alter service, so you don't end up at a station that is closed, or waiting for a bus that isn't coming.\n\n\u25ba Live Directions with Get Off Notifications guide you step-by-step in real time as you travel. Know exactly where you\u2019re walking, how long (or should we say how short) you\u2019re waiting, and how many stops are left. You can focus on anything you want while riding because Moovit will alert you when it\u2019s time to get off--no need to constantly re-check whether yours is the next stop. \n\n\u25ba Bike Share - For sunny days, days you don\u2019t feel like walking, days when you feel like a little extra exercise & many other days\n\n\u25ba Real Time Arrival information (where available) lets you know when to be at the stop so you can spend your time doing something more valuable than sitting around and waiting\n\n\u25ba Global Coverage in over 750 cities means that when you travel, you will still be able to ride public transit like a local\n\n\u25ba Favorites Screen lets you save locations and frequently used lines so that you get going with a single tap\n\n\u25ba Moovit Widget gives you immediate access to your favorite lines & locations making checking public transportation as easy as checking the weather\n\n\u25ba Service Alerts keep you in the know so you don't end up waiting for a bus that isn't coming, or sitting on a train because of a delay that could have been avoided. When you save your favorite lines, Moovit sends you a message when there is an issue that would affect your travels\n\n\u25ba Live Ride tracks your ride & alerts you when you\u2019re approaching, and when you arrive at your stop. So even when you know exactly where you\u2019re going, your mind can indulge in a wandering day dream\n\n\u25ba Line & System Maps let you view any local transit map available as a PDF file\n\nRide with Moovit in 100+ cities across the US:\n\u2022New York\n\u2022Los Angeles\n\u2022San Francisco\n\u2022Boston\n\u2022Chicago\n\u2022Philadelphia\n\u2022Washington DC\n\u2022Austin\n\u2022Seattle\n\u2022Miami and more.\n\nMoovit supports all major transit operators including:\n\u2022MTA\n\u2022New Jersey Transit\n\u2022LIRR\n\u2022MBTA\n\u2022WMATA\n\u2022SEPTA\n\u2022CTA\n\u2022Pace\n\u2022LA Metro\n\u2022Metrolink\n\u2022SFMTA\n\u2022AC Trans\n\u2022BART\n\u2022VTA\n\u2022OCTA\n\u2022Amtrak\n\u2022King County Metro\n\u2022Miami Dade Transit\n\u2022MDT\n\u2022Metro\n\u2022Muni\n\u2022MARTA\n\u2022RTD\n\u2022CATA\n\u2022MWRTA\n\u2022Metrorail\n\u2022Bart\n\u2022Beeline Bus\n\u2022Norwalk Transit\n\u2022Dash Ladot\n\u2022DC circulator\n\u2022Torrance Transit and more\u2026\n\nBike sharing provided by: \n\u2022Bay Area Bike Share\n\u2022B-cycle\n\u2022Bike Chattanooga\n\u2022Bublr Bikes\n\u2022Capital BikeShare\n\u2022CAT Bike\n\u2022Citi Bike\n\u2022Citi Bike Miami\n\u2022CoGo\n\u2022Decobike San Diego\n\u2022Divvy\n\u2022Flashfleet\n\u2022Healthy Ride\n\u2022Hubway\n\u2022Hudsonbikeshare\n\u2022Indiana Pacers Bikeshare\n\u2022Nice Ride\n\u2022Pronto Cycle Share\n\u2022Skybike\n\u2022SLC Bike Share\n\u2022WE-cycle\n\nYou can find us in hundreds of cities around the world including: \n\u2022UK (London, Birmingham, Manchester)\n\u2022Spain (Barcelona, Madrid)\n\u2022Italy (Rome, Milan, Napoli)\n\u2022France (Paris, Bordeaux)\n\u2022Poland (Warsaw, Lublin, and more)\n\u2022Sweden (Stockholm)\n\u2022Finland (Helsinki)\n\u2022Hungary (Budapest)\n\u2022Russia (Moscow)\n\u2022Netherlands\n\u2022Israel\n\u2022Brazil (Rio, Sao Paulo)\n\u2022Chile (Santiago)\n\u2022Colombia (Bogota)\n\u2022Mexico City\n\u2022Peru (Lima)\n\u2022New Zealand\n\u2022Philippines\n\u2022Malaysia\n\u2022Greece (Athens)\n\u2022South Korea (Seoul)\n\u2022Norway (Oslo)\n\nNote: Continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","short_desc":"#1 global app for public transportation.
