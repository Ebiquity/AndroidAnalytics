Do not overcharge by keeping your device plugged in nor undercharge by charging in short bursts whenever convenient. \n\nQ: How does \"Saving Mode\" work?\nA: \"Saving Mode\" is an extreme setting that shuts down all non-essential functions of your phone with exception of making phone calls and sending\/receiving text messages. WiFi, Data, GPS, etc will all be shut down to ensure battery life and defend your juice.\n\nQ: How do I set up the widgets?\nA: The \"Task Killer\" widget will automatically appear on your home screen with installation.
