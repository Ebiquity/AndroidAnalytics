Depending on how good your phone is, it can become a high-powered listening device (like a hearing aid or a super Spy App). It is the Ultimate Eavesdropping Tool -- the latest in personal espionage. Click on the center button, and you can hear the world around you. Use it to observe your surroundings and monitor what is going on.\n\nWhether you want to eavesdrop on conversations or just hear the TV better, Ear Spy aims to give you super hearing and improve what you hear. There's more going on around you than you might realize. It's time to hear it. \n\nHEADPHONES REQUIRED. Failure to use headphones will result in awful audio feedback. You have been warned!\n\nNOTE ON REVIEWS: Please review the app if you try it. But I know you hate leaving reviews . . . because I hate leaving reviews. So, if you can think of nothing to say . . .just leave a review saying \"Rad\" if you love it or \"Bogus\" if you hate it. Or, just say \"Eh\" if you have no opinion. However, I love full and honest reviews as they really help us . . . but anything is good. Five stars would be awesome. Now, back to what the app does . . . .\n\nEar Spy is a \"Super Spy\" application which gives you super-hearing and the ability to eavesdrop on those around you. With some bluetooth headsets, you can eavesdrop from the next room (tested with the Motorola HT820 Headset).\n\nEar Spy amplifies sound coming through your phone microphone straight to your earphones. To fine-tune the incoming signal, use the graphic audio equalizer to tactically tune in to your surrounding environment.\n\nPerfect for the inquisitive spy within you who wants to snoop or overhear things. But also perfect for those who are hard of hearing or suffer hearing loss (many people use it as a hearing aid). It\u2019s not just used to listen in on what others are saying.\n\nUpgrade to the pro version for some great added benefits:\n--An extended Graphic Equalizer (more than 5 bands if your phone permits it)\n--Echo Cancellation (AEC)\n--Noise Suppression (NS)\n--Virtualizer (Android 4.1 and above)\n--Automatic Gain Control (AGC)\n--Bass-Boost (Bass)\n--MP3 Recording\n--Home Screen Widget\n--Ad-Free Spying!\n\nLearn more about Ear Spy by going to http:\/\/www.earspyapp.com\/. \n\nTo find out how to use Ear Spy, here is a tutorial on Youtube: https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=k4AdynDFD0A\n\nAre you a blogger?
