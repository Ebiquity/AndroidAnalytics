Use Lyft to get an affordable ride in minutes. Instead of hailing a cab or waiting for the bus, just request a car with the tap of a button, and get picked up by a nearby friendly driver who\u2019ll take you to your destination right away. Enjoy a welcoming, affordable, and memorable ride today. \nOur app is cheaper than a taxi, faster than the bus, and easy to use. \n\n\u2022 Getting Started: After downloading Lyft and signing up, simply open the app and request a ride. \n\n\u2022 Paying: Never worry about having cash for a cab or the bus again \u2014 with Lyft, you pay through your phone. It\u2019s easy, fast, and secure.\n\n\u2022 Split the Cost: Easily split the cost of a ride with friends through the app. No more IOU\u2019s. \n\n\nAbout Our Drivers\n\u2022 All Lyft drivers pass comprehensive background and DMV checks before being approved for the service.\n\n\u2022 Drivers are rated by passengers and only the highest-rated drivers are allowed on the road.\n\n\u2022 Lyft provides a first-of-its-kind $1M liability insurance for total peace of mind.\n\n\nJoin the millions who\u2019ve chosen Lyft instead of a cab for commuting, going out at night, and getting to events. Next time you need a ride, skip the bus, taxi, or car service and choose Lyft.\n\n\u2014\nWhat people are saying:\n\n\"Ride-sharing programs like Lyft are providing commuters with less expensive and more social ways to get around. Users log into the app, specify where they\u2019re heading, and a background-checked driver picks them up for less than a typical cab ride.\" - TODAY Show on how Lyft works\n\n\"In a city where taxis can be scarce and Uber\u2019s black town cars are rampant but expensive, Lyft has quickly gained visibility due to low prices and quirky branding.\" - Ad Age on what differentiates Lyft\n\n\"Lyft's focus on the everyman has recently extended to the wildly successful Lyft Line carpool service aimed at commuters, which offers discounts of 30% to 60% for sharing a Lyft ride with others.\" - Fast Company on Lyft Line\n\n\u201c...Special emphasis was put on making rides reflect the values of the company. The founders didn\u2019t want the experience to be like a taxi or an Uber ride, where a passenger sat in the back and didn\u2019t interact with the driver.\u201d - Techcrunch on Lyft\u2019s community values\n\n\u201cLyft is a foreign country for an Uber refugee, but it doesn't take long to feel at home there.\u201d - Mashable, on switching to Lyft from Uber \n\n\u201c A few weeks ago, one Lyft driver served me homemade lemon bread. The experience feels less mercenary than taking an Uber ride, as if you\u2019re engaging a friend rather than a chauffeur, which is exactly the atmosphere you\u2019d want in a daily car pool.\u201d - New York Times, on the difference between Lyft and Uber \n\n\u2014\nFor Lyft drivers using the app, continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","rating":4.2516160011292,"category":"Transportation","cat_int":22,"cat_type":0,"cat_key":"TRANSPORTATION","price":"","price_numeric":0,"iap":false,"iap_min":0,"iap_max":0,"downloads":"1,000,000 - 5,000,000","version":"Varies with device","content_rating":"Everyone","what_is_new":"Drumroll, please!
