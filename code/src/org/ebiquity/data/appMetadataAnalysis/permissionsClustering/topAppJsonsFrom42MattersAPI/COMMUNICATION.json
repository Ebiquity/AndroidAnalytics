DESCRIPTION:\nSideline\u2122 is the free 2nd number for your smartphone. It uses your existing carrier network and minutes so your 2nd number works anywhere your cell phone does. Since Sideline provides carrier reliability, it\u2019s the go-to phone solution for small businesses, entrepreneurs, freelancers, or anyone who needs a 2nd phone line for privacy. You can finally stop using your cell number for work and keep your personal number private. \n\nGET A FREE NUMBER IN YOUR AREA CODE\nSelect a local area code and get a number that works wherever you do. You get to talk and text from a 2nd phone line\u2014and because it\u2019s a real number, you can call or text anyone. \n\nCARRIER RELIABILITY \nSideline works with your carrier network to give you the same great quality and reliability you get from your regular cell number. This also lets you share your calling\u00a0minutes (which are probably unlimited) between two numbers. Compared to \u201ccloud-based,\u201d \u201cvirtual,\u201d or \u201cVoIP\u201d phone systems, Sideline uses a minimal amount of data for general functionality.\n\nCALLING & TEXTING\nYour second number is just like your first. Separate caller IDs, notifications, and ringtones make it clear who\u2019s contacting you. For outbound communication, just open Sideline. With your free phone number, you get unlimited texting and Sideline calling uses the carrier plan you already have.\n\nKEEP YOUR PERSONAL NUMBER PRIVATE\nYou shouldn\u2019t give your personal number to everyone\u2014that\u2019s why there\u2019s\u00a0Sideline. But it\u2019s not just a 2nd line for work. It can be your temporary number. Your anonymous number.\u00a0Your business number. Your disposable number. Your fake phone number. It\u2019s whatever you need it to be to protect your primary cell number.\n\nVOICEMAIL FORWARDING & AUTO-REPLY\nOn nights, weekends, or holidays, you can always silence Sideline and send callers to voicemail. You can even set up multiple voicemails or auto-text replies to customize your greeting for any circumstance. \n\nSIDELINE PRO $2.99\/ month\nSideline Pro removes ads, enables Wi-Fi calling, and prevents your number from expiring (we\u00a0reclaim inactive numbers from non-subscribers after 30 days). Wi-Fi calling lets you toggle between networks in case you have a weaker carrier signal. Look for more features to come!\n\nSideline Pro subscriptions are automatically billed monthly to your Google Play Account and auto-renew. You\u00a0can turn off auto-renew in your account settings.\u00a0If\u00a0you don\u2019t want to pay for Sideline, you can simply\u00a0continue using it for free.\u00a0\n\nSee our\u00a0privacy policy and terms of use\u00a0(they make a great bedtime story).\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","short_desc":"A second phone number that works just like your first.","rating":4.3814816474915,"category":"Communication","cat_int":5,"cat_type":0,"cat_key":"COMMUNICATION","price":"","price_numeric":0,"iap":true,"iap_min":0.99,"iap_max":2.99,"size":14680064,"downloads":"1,000,000 - 5,000,000","downloads_min":1000000,"downloads_max":5000000,"version":"1.14.1","content_rating":"Everyone","what_is_new":"We\u2019re always trying to improve our service.
