Originally developed as Google Sky Map, it has now been donated and open sourced.\n\nTroubleshooting\/FAQ\nThe Map doesn't move\/points in the wrong place\nMake sure you haven't switched into manual mode. Does your phone have a compass? If not, Sky Map cannot tell your orientation. Look it up here: http:\/\/www.gsmarena.com\/ \n\nTry calibrating your compass by moving it in a figure of 8 motion or as described here https:\/\/support.google.com\/gmm\/answer\/6145351.\nAre there any magnets or metal nearby that might interfere with the compass? Try switching off \"magnetic correction\" (in settings) and see if that is more accurate.\n\nWhy is autolocation not supported for my phone?\nIn Android 6 the way permissions work has changed. You need to enable the location permission setting for Sky Map as described here:\nhttps:\/\/support.google.com\/googleplay\/answer\/6270602?p=app_permissons_m\n\nThe Map is jittery\nTry adjusting the sensor speed and damping (in settings).\n\nDo I need an internet connection?\nNo, but some functions (like entering your location manually) won't work without one. You'll have to use the GPS or enter a latitude and longitude instead.\n\nCan I help test the latest features?\nSure!
